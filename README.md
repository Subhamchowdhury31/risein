## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based voting platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It enables secure, transparent, and anonymous voting on various issues or candidates. Each vote is immutable and verifiable, making it suitable for public elections, organizational decision-making, and other scenarios that require trustworthy, collective input.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to leverage blockchain technology to create a voting system where every vote counts and is secure from tampering or fraud. This system provides real-time results and guarantees transparency for users.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Poll Creation**: Users can create polls with custom questions and candidates.
- **Immutable Voting Process**: Once cast, votes are permanently recorded on the blockchain.
- **Anonymous Voting**: Ensures user privacy while maintaining vote verifiability.
- **Real-time Voting Statistics**: Each vote is instantly counted and reflected in the poll results.
